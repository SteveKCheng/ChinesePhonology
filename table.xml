  <s:heading>What is Middle Chinese?</s:heading>

  <p>
    <s:term>Middle Chinese</s:term> <p:mc>中古漢語</p:mc> represents the stages of Chinese 
    presumed to have been spoken roughly between 200 AD to 1300 AD, from the start of the 
    Three Kingdoms period (after the Han dynasties)
    to the Song dynasties (before the invasion of China by the Mongols).  Informally, we may 
    treat it a language like any other in history, which can be subjected to linguistic
    study, e.g. using the comparative method.  But technically speaking, Middle Chinese is 
    a constructed system of pronunciation, which has been passed down to us through
    written records of philologists from that era and since.  
  </p>

  <p>
    We know, from the written record, that fairly divergent dialects of Chinese even 
    existed back then, so certainly no one could be said to have <em>spoken a single
    language</em> called "Middle Chinese".  However, what linguists have been able to deduce is that
    varieties of Chinese had evolved from a proto-language with the following characteristics:

    <ul>
      <li>Its spoken form was primarily monosyllabic: not only everyday words, but even vocabulary that
      we would consider rather specialized today, like names of species of plants and animals,
      consisted of one syllable. <s:cite key="Xiàng 2023 Ⅳ" sec="2" />
      </li>
      <li>Only later were multi-syllabic words  incorporated into everyday language, often replacing 
      old monosyllabic 
      words as the latter became too ambiguous.   
      Not only because the limits on the number of distinguishable phonological 
      features were hit, preventing the coining of new words with new syllables, 
      but also individual monosyllabic words were increasingly overloaded with many shades of meaning, 
      or even completely new meanings, as society evolved to articulate new concepts.
      <s:cite key="Xiàng 2023 Ⅳ" sec="3" />
      </li>
      <li>It had a distinctive written form consisting of "characters", whose modern, evolved form
      are recognizable to many people today. </li>
      <li>Each character was pronounced as one syllable.   
      For monosyllabic words that means one character
      corresponds to one word.  For compound words made of a series of monosyllabic morphemes, the
      compound word would be written with the corresponding characters to those monosyllabic morphemes.
      Genuinely multi-syllabic morphemes (usually disyllabic) would still be written with multiple
      characters even if though the characters may have no meaning outside of being part of the
      multi-syllabic morpheme. </li>
      <li>The above key aspects of the language are retained to this day in modern Chinese dialects. </li>
      <li>Many of the phonological changes in varieties of Chinese could be analyzed syllable-by-syllable
      — though not all, of course.  
      So we can effectively speak of a Chinese character having certain a "pronunciation" at a certain
      time and place, and how it changes throughout
      history across different dialects. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The proto-language that Middle Chinese evolved from is called <s:term>Old Chinese</s:term>
    <p:mc>上古漢語</p:mc>.  Old Chinese is way beyond the scope of this article, and its re-construction
    is subject to considerable uncertainty.  But knowing some
    aspects of its evolution is still useful, in shedding light on certain pecularities of Middle Chinese.
    We will point out some of the salient details as we go along.
  </p>

</s:section>

<s:section>
  <s:heading>Primary sources on Middle Chinese</s:heading>

  <p>
    We give a brief overview of the major kinds of data we have on Middle Chinese.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <s:term>Rhyme dictionaries</s:term>, which list out groups of characters that sound the same
        or similar. As the term implies, one of the purposes of rhyme dictionaries were to 
        help ancient poets write rhyming poetry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <s:term>Rhyme tables</s:term>, which list out all the syllables of the language systematically,
        arranged in two-dimensional tables where all the possible initial consonants run 
        across one axis, and the all the possible ending vowel sounds run across the other axis. 
      </li>
      <li>
        The ancient poetry whose verses are supposed to rhyme, from which sinologists can deduce
        which characters sound the same or similar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other dictionary-like and expository texts written in ancient times.  As one might expect,
        ancient terminology and notation were nowhere as precise as in modern linguistics, 
        but Chinese writers had still managed to write down tidbits of useful information, 
        influenced as they were by the methods of phonological analysis that ancient India brought to 
        bear on Sanskrit.
      </li>
      <li>
        How characters are actually pronounced or read 
        in modern times in Chinese dialects and sino-xenic languages obviously give input
        as to how Middle Chinese sounded.  (This kind of analysis would be called 
        the <s:term>comparative method</s:term> in the field of linguistics.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Phonetic transcriptions of known foreign terms/loanwords into Chinese characters also give clues
        to ancient character pronunciation.  To give an example that everybody can recognize, 
        the word <em>buddha</em> was, and continues to be to this day, phonetically approximated 
        by the character
        <p:mc>佛</p:mc>.  From this fact we may surmise that this character was originally
        pronounced with a <p:i>b-</p:i> initial consonant, despite it being pronounced today 
        as <p:py>fó</p:py> in Mandarin and <p:yp>fat⁶</p:yp> in Cantonese, though it is indeed
        pronounced as <p:jr>butu</p:jr> (<p:j>仏</p:j>) in Japanese.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <s:heading>Rhyme dictionaries</s:heading>

    <p>
              , exemplified by the work <p:ac>廣韻</p:ac>,
          completed in 1011 AD in the Northern Song dynasty <s:cite key="Dǒng 2008" pages="58–59" />.
          Such dictionaries list out <s:term>rhymes</s:term>, which are sets of characters which end
          in a similar (but not necessarily the same) sound.  Each rhyme is represented by a head character <p:ac>韻目</p:ac>.

    </p>
        <p>
          In the first page, reproduced below, from the table of contents of the first volume of
          <p:ac>廣韻</p:ac>, 
          we can see 18 rhymes listed: <p:ac>東</p:ac>, <p:ac>冬</p:ac>, <p:ac>鍾</p:ac>, and so on.
          <img class="page" src="https://ytenx.org/static/img/DrakDzuonDang/volume1/p014.jpg" />
        </p>
        <p>
          Each rhyme is further divided into sub-groups of completely homophonous characters.  For instance,
          the first rhyme <p:ac>東</p:ac> contains the sub-groups <p:ac>東</p:ac>, <p:ac>菄</p:ac>, 
          <p:ac>鶇</p:ac> and so on, as shown below:
          <img class="page" src="https://ytenx.org/static/img/DrakDzuonDang/volume1/p015.jpg" />.
        </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      It is mentioned that at the beginning of the Kāihuáng 開皇 era (AD 581–600) of the
      reign of Emperor Wen of Sui, there was a small gathering hosted by 
      <p:ac>陸法言</p:ac> (Lù Fǎyán), 
      where discussions about correct pronunciations came up. They noted that the 
      dialects at that time had considerable phonological differences, and a standard or
      correct pronunciation system was need by scholars and their students. Therefore,
      they compared the pronunciations from the south and the north and decided on
      the correct pronunciations, often with reference to older rhyme dictionaries, thus
      producing the first manuscript of the <p:ac>切韻</p:ac> (Qièyùn).

    <li id="泥-vs-娘">
      <p>
        Some authors merge <p:ac p:lg="initials38">娘</p:ac> into 
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">泥</p:ac>, on the belief that
        they were not pronounced any differently, at least
        by the time the <p:ac>廣韻</p:ac> was written. Nevertheless
        it can be confirmed in the present day there 
        remains a phonemic distinction, in that the 
        <p:ac>反切</p:ac> from 
        <p:ac>廣韻</p:ac>
          form two equivalence classes for 
        <p:ac>泥</p:ac> and
        <p:ac>娘</p:ac>. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li id="舌上音">
      <p>
        Early re-constructions of Middle Chinese determine these
        initials to be (alveolo-)palatal stops <p:mc>舌面塞音</p:mc>.
        The consensus seems to have settled on these being retroflex,
        after considering they might have emerged from a medial *r
        from Old Chinese. The philological term 
        <p:ac>舌上音</p:ac>, literally meaning
        "above-tongue sound", is itself ambiguous on this matter.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li id="齒上音">
      <p>
        <p:ac>齒上音</p:ac> is a relatively modern appellation for these initials.
        In other texts, this row may simply be called <p:ac>正齒音</p:ac>, mixing it up
        with the next row for the alveolo-palatal sibilants.  <p:ac>正齒音</p:ac> was
        the original Chinese philological term, but only in the 19<sup>th</sup> century 
        did <p:mc>陳澧</p:mc> (in his pioneering work <p:mc>《切韻考》</p:mc>)
        discovered that, what had been called <p:ac>正齒音</p:ac> consisted of two
        sets of initials.  Later investigations revealed that the initials
        in this row (i.e. <p:ac>齒上音</p:ac>) were likely retroflex in the same way as 
        <p:ac>舌上音</p:ac>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li id="laryngeals">
      <p>
        The consonants 
        are definitely grouped very oddly in this row: 
        we elect to do so to make the table more compact, at the
        same time adhering to established convention from Chinese philology.
        From the modern point of view,
        <p:i>x</p:i>, <p:i>ɣ</p:i> are clearly velars, while 
        <p:i>j</p:i> is a palatal glide.
        (On the other hand, <p:ac>喉音</p:ac> literally
        means "throat sounds".)
        The details are too complicated to get into here, but
        initials referred to by
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">匣</p:ac>, 
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">云</p:ac>,
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">以</p:ac> had gotten mixed up historically
        because of sound mergers, explaining why they all ended up
        being categorized as <p:ac>喉音</p:ac>. However, they are
        distinguishable as (three) equivalent classes in
        <p:ac>反切</p:ac> from the <p:ac>廣韻</p:ac>.
        Many authors, in the modern context,
        categorize these initials into the respective rows for
        velars and palatals. 
      </p>
    </li>
    <li id="半齒音">
      <p>
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">日</p:ac> is often categorized into the 
        row for <p:ac>正齒音</p:ac>, as those initials there
        were also articulated with the palate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, one may still encounter a phonetic description like
        <p:i>nʑ</p:i> for the <p:ac>日</p:ac> initial.
        That is plain wrong as a sound value, because consonant 
        clusters were already lost 
        by the period of Early Middle Chinese, but is meant to suggest
        that it is the precursor to the retroflex that later developed in
        northern Chinese varieties (e.g. <p:py>r-</p:py> in <p:mc>普通話</p:mc>
        which can be pronounced as <p:i>ʐ</p:i>), while southern Chinese varieties
        might have preserved the nasal pronunciation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The philological term <p:ac>半齒音</p:ac>, literally "half-tooth sound", 
        was probably meant to suggest this initial did 
        become a sound like <p:i>ʐ</p:i>
        in later Chinese varieties, 
        as opposed to <p:ac>半舌音</p:ac> (below) meaning "half-tongue sound".
      </p>
      <p>
        The reader may notice too, interestingly enough, in Japanese 
        this initial similarly became <p:jr>z-</p:jr>.

    </li>
    <li id="半舌音">
      <p>
        <p:ac p:lg="initials38">來</p:ac> is often categorized into the 
        row for <p:ac>舌頭音</p:ac>.
