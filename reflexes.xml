      <p>
        From the name <p:j>呉音</p:j>, many are tempted to think that the pronunciations
        are based on the Wú <p:mc>吳</p:mc> dialects, i.e. the dialect group that includes Shanghaiese.  
        That statement is not
        accurate according to Japanese scholars 
        <s:cite-group>
          <s:cite key="Tōdō 1980" pages="166" />
          <s:cite key="Yano 2008" />
        </s:cite-group>. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        Although the appellation of <p:mc>吳</p:mc> did indeed refer to the geographical 
        region south of the Yangzi River <p:mc>長江</p:mc> — in modern 
        times usually called <p:mc>江南</p:mc> Jiāngnán — 
        in ancient times, the Chinese term <p:mc>吳音</p:mc> could generally mean 
        “a local dialect” in opposition to whatever the official standard of speech
        <p:mc>標準音</p:mc> was at that time
        <s:cite key="Satō 1987" pages="61" />.
      </p>

      <p>  
        <p:mc>吳</p:mc> just happened to be
        the most well-known area in China that ‘non-standard dialects’ were widely
        spoken: the result of mixing with indigenous languages, after this prosperous
        population centre was settled/conquered by those who spoke the ‘original’
        version of ancient Chinese.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not surprisingly, such local dialects were, in the eyes of 
        ancient Chinese officials, 
        inferior to their
        ‘elegant speech’ <p:ac>雅言</p:ac>.
        It is possible that when the Japanese language first acquired the readings of
        Go-on <p:j>呉音</p:j>, they were not called by that name.
        Indeed an older alternative name for the readings was <p:j>和音</p:j>
        <s:cite-group>
          <s:cite key="Satō 1987" pages="60" />
          <s:cite key="Yano 2008" pages="38" />
        </s:cite-group>.
        Only after Japanese ambassadors to the Táng Dynasty returned to Japan, 
        carrying their
        own knowledge of Chinese character readings,
        based on the official speech 
        from the capital,
        that they retroactively labelled the 
        pronunciations of old as 
        <p:j>呉音</p:j>, borrowing the Chinese terminology.
      </p>  

      <p>
        Furthermore, historical evidence indicates that the readings of
        <p:j>呉音</p:j> were passed to Japan from Korea, over a fairly long
        period.  That is, there may well not have been a single dialect, 
        spoken at a particular point in time, that solely contributes
        to the readings of <p:j>呉音</p:j> 
        <s:cite-group>
          <s:cite key="Sinica 1992" pages="568–569" />
          <s:cite key="Yano 2008" pages="41 54" />
        </s:cite-group>.
        To this day, 
        inconsistencies in how Middle Chinese sounds are represented 
        can be seen in <p:j>呉音</p:j>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many authors, particularly Chinese authors, remark that
        Japanese kanji readings most closely resemble the Southern Min dialects 
        <p:mc>閩南話</p:mc> today <s:cite key="Sinica 1992" sec="21" />,
        perhaps implying that the former is based on the latter.
        Certainly the similarities are obvious and cannot be denied,
        such as that 
        <p:ac>知</p:ac> has a <em>t-</em>
        initial in 
        Japanese and Southern Min, 
        not having merged with <p:ac>正齒音</p:ac> as in most other
        Chinese dialects.  
      </p>

      <p>
        However, some similarities may have been the result
        of convergent evolution.  For example, 
        <s:cite key="Sinica 1992" sec="21" /> says these
        sound changes:
        
        <ol>
          <li><p:i>p</p:i> to <p:i>h</p:i></li>
          <li><p:i>ɣ</p:i> to <p:i>k</p:i></li>
          <li><p:i>tsʰ</p:i>, <p:i>tʂʰ</p:i>,  <p:i>tɕ</p:i> to <p:i>s</p:i></li>
        </ol>

        had occurred in both
        Japanese and Southern Min, but they might have had arisen independently
        in Japanese, either at the time it 
        adapted Middle Chinese pronunciations to its
        far simpler sound system, or as part of general 
        phonological changes years after.
        For instance, item ① is widely-known change in Japanese that 
        had started occurring sometime in the 16<sup>th</sup> 
        century (with <p:i>p</p:i> firstly changing to <p:i>ɸ</p:i>), 
        and applies not only to Sino-Japanese but also native vocabulary
